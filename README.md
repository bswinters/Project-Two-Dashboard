Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable can be a simple task. Writing code that can be easily understood and interpretted by your program of choice is very important. You must also avoid reptetitive functions or information when necessary. 

One of the main advantages of working this way is that it forces you to be detailed oriented while also keeping the larger picture in mind. 

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist is all about research in my opionion. You must collect a good amount of information before you begin solving your problem, you may also need to keep searching throughout the lifecycle of your problem or project to find a more efficient way to complete what you must. 

Computer scientist are problem solvers, they solve known problems, uncover new problems, and improve current strategies through research and careful implementation. My work on this type of project may help a company like Grazioso Salvare focus on details of their systems while also considering how to slowly improve overall.
